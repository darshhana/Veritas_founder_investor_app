---

### Step 3: Matchmaking Feature
**What Investor Sees:**
- **Investment Thesis Card**: Their preferences (industries, stages, MRR range, etc.)
- **Matched Founders**: Founders sorted by match score
- Each match shows:
  - Company & founder name
  - Match percentage
  - Stage, industry, location
  - MRR, churn rate (if available)
  - Description

**How Matching Works:**
- Queries `ingestionResults` for all pitches
- Calculates match score based on:
  - Memo 2 confidence score (if available)
  - Industry alignment with investor thesis
  - Stage alignment
  - Simple heuristic if no Memo 2

**Data Sources:**
- `ingestionResults` ‚Üí Founder/company data
- `diligenceResults` ‚Üí Match scores (if diligence run)
- `investorProfiles` ‚Üí Investor preferences (thesis)

---

### Step 4: Ground Truth Engine (Verification)
**What Investor Sees:**
- **Verified Claims**: Claims from pitches that were verified
- **Discrepancies**: Claims that couldn't be verified or contradicted
- **Unverifiable Claims**: Claims that need manual verification

**How It Works:**
- Queries `diligenceResults` collection
- Extracts `strengths` (verified claims) from `memo1_diligence`
- Extracts `weaknesses` (discrepancies) from `memo1_diligence`
- Links back to `ingestionResults` to get founder/company names

**Data Structure:**
```
diligenceResults/{docId}
  memo1_diligence: {
    strengths: [
      "Claim 1 verified",
      "Claim 2 verified"
    ],
    weaknesses: [
      "Discrepancy found in X",
      "Risk identified in Y"
    ],
    verification_status: {
      verified_claims: [...],
      unverified_claims: [...]
    }
  }
```

---

### Step 5: AI Interviewer
**What Investor Can Do:**
1. **Schedule AI Interviews** with founders
2. View **scheduled interviews**
3. View **completed interviews** with transcripts
4. See interview scores

**Data Flow:**
- Investor schedules interview ‚Üí Creates document in `scheduledInterviews` or `interviews` collection
- Interview conducted ‚Üí Transcript stored
- Results displayed in app

**Data Structure:**
```
interviews/{docId} or scheduledInterviews/{docId}
{
  founder_email: "...",
  investor_email: "...",
  startup_name: "...",
  scheduled_time: Timestamp,
  status: "scheduled" | "in_progress" | "completed",
  questions: [...],
  transcript: "...",
  score: 85
}
```

---

### Step 6: AI Explainability
**What Investor Sees:**
- **Model Insights**: Type of AI, number of analyses, average scores
- **Performance Metrics**: Accuracy, confidence trends over time
- **Feature Importance**: Which factors matter most (Team, Market, Technology, etc.)
- **Recent Predictions**: Investment recommendations for recent pitches
- **Charts**: Visual representation of AI performance

**Data Source:**
- Queries `diligenceResults` collection (59 documents you have)
- Calculates:
  - Average confidence scores
  - Feature importance from strengths/weaknesses
  - Prediction trends over time
  - Accuracy metrics

**This is why you see "59 analyses"** - there are 59 documents in `diligenceResults`!

## üîç WHY YOU'RE SEEING EMPTY SCREENS

### Current Status:
- ‚úÖ **AI Explainability**: Shows "59 analyses" (working - has data)
- ‚ùå **AI Diligence Engine**: Empty (should show 5 pitches)
- ‚ùå **Matchmaking**: Empty (should show 5 founders)
- ‚ùå **Ground Truth Engine**: Empty (needs Memo 2 data)
- ‚ùå **AI Interviewer**: Empty (no scheduled interviews)

### The Issue:
Your `ingestionResults` has **5 documents** but they're not showing because:
1. Code might not be handling array fields correctly (FIXED ‚úÖ)
2. Timestamp parsing might fail (FIXED ‚úÖ)
3. UI might not be rendering (need to check logs)

### Next Steps:
1. Check terminal logs when opening Diligence tab
2. Look for the diagnostic output
3. Verify if data is being loaded but not displayed, or not loaded at all
